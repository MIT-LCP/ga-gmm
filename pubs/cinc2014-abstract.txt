Predicting mortality in intensive care units (ICU) remains a significant challenge. The problem is faced 
by physicians and patients' families alike, both in terms of triaging resources and accessing whether to 
switch code status from full status, to do not resuscitate (DNR) to comfort measures only (CMO). 
Common methods of predicting mortality, such as Severity of Acute Physiology Scure (SAPS) or the 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE), use a combination of features to assess 
patient condition. However, both SAPS and APACHE tend to have poor predictivity across a 
population of patients. Our hypothesis is that in any given population, patient phenotypes can 
be clustered and that different features could be used to predict mortality for 
different patient subgroups. To assess this hypothesis we propose a data-drive approach that uses 
a genetic algorithm (GA) coupled with Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify which features best 
predict mortality for different patient subgroups. We extracted 50 variables from the MIMIC-II database 
from the first 24 hours of an ICU stay for patients admited to the ICU with sepsis. Median values for each 
variable were calculated, with the addition of trend information for vital sign variables where higher 
frequency data was available. The final feature vector consists of 152 parameters. Each iteration of the GA 
was terminated when a particular mixture in the GMM had a 28-mortality prediction AUC greater than 0.75. 
Patients associated with the most predictive mixture were removed from the training dataset and the GA is 
repeated to identify additional patient subgroups. The top 5 predictive mixtures were used in an ensemble 
classifier and compared against SAPS-I and a simple SVM classifier using all 152 parameters.
